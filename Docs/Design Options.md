## TileMapComponent Design Options


**THIS IS A DRAFT**

### Overview

Tilemaps are a common technichique for storing/drawing 2D worlds. This is an overview of proposed `TileMapComponent`. The goal of the project is to provide tilemap functionality for the [Xenko Engine](http://xenko.com).

Desired Outcomes:
 * A [TileMapComponent](#TileMapComponent) (obviously). Initial only supporting orthagonal tiles.
 * Tile set [assets](#Assets).
 * Ability to import maps and tile sets from [tiled](#Tiled) files (TMX,TSX)
 * [Physics](#Physics)
 * Edit tile maps/tiles sets in Xenko [Game Studio](#Game-Studio-Editors).
